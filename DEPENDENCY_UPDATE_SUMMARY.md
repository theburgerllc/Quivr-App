### 🛠️ Configuration Changes

#### 1. Created `.npmrc`
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```
This handles peer dependency conflicts with React 19 and packages not yet fully updated.

#### 2. Created `eslint.config.js`
- Migrated to ESLint 9 flat config format
- Configured TypeScript, React, and Prettier support
- Set up proper globals and ignores

### 📋 Next Steps

1. **Test your application thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Update any breaking changes**:
   - **Tailwind CSS v4**: Check for any CSS changes needed
   - **Zod v4**: Review validation schemas for any API changes
   - **react-simple-maps v4 beta**: Test map functionality

3. **Consider updating ESLint config**:
   - The old `.eslintrc.json` can be removed
   - Review and customize the new `eslint.config.js` as needed

4. **Monitor for updates**:
   - `react-simple-maps` is using a beta version - watch for stable v4 release
   - Some packages may still need to update for full React 19 support

### 🚀 Commands Summary

All deprecated packages have been removed and replaced with their modern equivalents:
```bash
# Verify no vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Check for deprecated packages (should show none)
npm ls inflight rimraf glob @humanwhocodes/config-array @humanwhocodes/object-schema

# Run linting with new ESLint 9
npm run lint

# Build and test
npm run build
```

### 📈 Benefits
- **Security**: Zero known vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Modern packages with better performance
- **Maintenance**: Using supported, actively maintained packages
- **Future-proof**: Ready for Node.js 22+ when needed
- **Developer Experience**: Latest tooling improvements

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Peer Dependencies**: Using `legacy-peer-deps` due to some packages not fully supporting React 19 yet. This is safe but should be reviewed periodically.

2. **Beta Package**: `react-simple-maps@4.0.0-beta.6` is a beta version. It works with React 19 but should be updated to stable v4 when available.

3. **ESLint Migration**: The project now uses ESLint 9's flat config. The old `.eslintrc.json` is no longer used and can be deleted.
